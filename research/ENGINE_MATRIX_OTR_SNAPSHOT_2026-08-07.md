# ENGINE MATRIX -- the per-model requirements record

-->

Every number here is read from the LIVE engine registry, so it cannot drift
from the adapters without the suite noticing. Written for multi-clip coverage
chunk 7a (2026-07-26), when every registered engine gained a declared
`FrameContract` and the per-engine opt-in was removed.

## How to read the clip window

`clip frames` is what ONE render call may legally produce. `step N` means the
ladder is arithmetic -- `min + k*N` -- so lengths off that grid have no legal
render and the planner renders the next length up and trims. `menu:` means the
provider serves a fixed set of lengths and nothing between them.

`clip seconds` is that window divided by `fps`. Where `fps` reads `canvas`, the
engine renders at whatever rate the canvas asks for and the seconds column is
meaningless rather than merely unknown -- it is marked `unbounded`.

**Google runs at 24 fps against a 25 fps canvas.** Veo's published menu is 4/6/8
SECONDS, which is 96/144/192 frames. The contract counts frames.

## What is NOT here, and why

* **The prompt text.** It is composed per episode by the story pass and varies
  per beat, so it is not a per-model requirement. What is recorded is the
  prompt CONTRACT: whether the lane takes text, and which conditioner rewrites
  it before it is sent.
* ~~**A resolution number for the local lanes.**~~ **RETRACTED 2026-08-02.**
  This omission was itself the defect. Refusing to print a local resolution
  "because the code never promised one" is exactly how `wan_i2v` came to sit on
  the shared 1472x832 landscape default with no opinion of its own, and how a
  profile asking for 832x480 could fail to reach the render. The number IS
  resolvable -- it is just resolved in three different places -- so the
  **effective canvas** column now walks the same precedence the driver walks and
  names which authority won.
* **The rate the cloud providers actually DELIVER at.** No adapter declares it
  and nothing in the tree reads it back; the cloud rows convert seconds at the
  canvas's 25 fps because that is what `_CloudVideoBase._duration_seconds`
  itself assumes. This is a real open gap, not an omission.

## Still requirements

own `still_plan`. `inherit_engine` means the still is minted at
the engine's own `aspect` column above.

## Effective render canvas

The canvas each engine ACTUALLY renders at, and which authority
decided it. `SHARED LANDSCAPE DEFAULT` means the engine expressed
no preference and inherited the composite canvas -- the dead
channel that cost `wan_8gb` a 268-minute leg. `engine _native_dims`
means the adapter sizes itself and IGNORES the request canvas.

## Multi-clip behaviour at a 442-frame beat

A 442-frame beat is 17.68 s at 25 fps -- long enough that every
bounded engine must split it. `render` is what the GPU or the
provider is asked to produce; `visible` is what survives to the
cut. They differ when a ladder has no legal length at the target
and the tail is trimmed -- so `render` is what VRAM must afford,
and `visible` is what the audio needs. `re-mints` counts stills
generated fresh per cut: a chained successor begins on its
predecessor's real terminal frame and owns no still, so only a
JUMP plan on a still-consuming lane ever re-mints.

## Frame caps and the evidence behind them

`evidence` lists every `docs/` receipt the adapter's own source
cites. **MISSING** means the adapter cites a document that is not
in this repo -- a safety number nobody can check. This column
exists because the HuMo 49-frame ceiling cited
`docs/2026-06-27-humo-bakeoff`, which has never been in the tree,
and it read exactly like a measured number until someone looked.
